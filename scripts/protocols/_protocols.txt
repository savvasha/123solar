$CMD_POOLING The command that request your com. app. You should use the ${'ADR'.$invt_num} variable as inverter adress (IP or RS-485) and ${'COMOPTION'.$invt_num} as parameter options.
$CMD_RETURN The com app return string. Always initialize to allow the 'Communication Error' test

$IxV, $IxA, $IxP are strings values. Voltage, Amperage and Power. (x range 4)
$GxV, $GxA, $GxP For grid phase x values (x range 3)
$FRQ Grid frequency

$EFF Inverter efficiency
$INVT, $BOOT Inverter temperature, booster (dc/dc) temperature

$KWHT is the total counter (a Wh precision is needed)

$RET should equal 'OK' only if the dataset is complete
