# What can 123Solar do for you ?
123Solar is a lightweight set of PHP/JS files that makes a web logger to monitor your photovoltaic inverter(s).
    
# Prerequisites
123Solar relies on communication(s) application(s) which are not included in this package.
As 123Solar is running on top of a webserver, you must grant the access to your communication(s) application(s) as well as your communication port(s) to the 'http' user.
Json, Calendar and Curl extensions have to be enable in php. Your webserver must allow HTTP authentication.
  
# Warning
Do not open inverter enclosure when under load. High-voltage can cause death or serious injuries !
Both AC and DC power must always be disconnected. Even though, this will not be still 100% safe as internal capacitors may remain charged after disconnecting all sources of power.

# Installation
- Install and test the communication application(s) for your inverter(s) and make sure it is reliable !
- Put the archive on your web server's folder then extract. (tar -xzvf 123solar*.tar.gz)
- Go then in your browser for configuration http://yourIP/123solar/admin/
- If the systemd unit is used, a sudoers file is needed, like www-data.sudoers file in examples
